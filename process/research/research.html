      <p>Out of all the atrocities that trump has engaged in during his administration, tons of migrant children were separated from their parents by the administration. According to nbc news, “at least 2,737 children of migrants detained at the
        border since summer 2017” (Soboroff and Romero). Out of all these children, the government itself has declared that reconnecting these children with their parents is nearly “impossible”. Not only that, but the administration itself doesn’t
        account for the mental damage and trauma ignited by this experience. The living conditions that these children faced inside the detainment camps was not completely feasible to the public eye. The only sources regarding the detainment camps
        living conditions are the ones revealed by the media. Many of the images are disturbing demonstrating how inhumane migrant children are treated. If the bare minimum was given by the government, it’s likely that psychological resources
        weren’t even provided towards the detained children.

        The whole process of reunification doesn’t guarantee happiness, but will the government take charge for the damage they’ve created amongst the children. There are many components to consider such as, “Years of separation, a history of grief
        and trauma, and the stresses of suddenly having to adapt to a new culture often get in the way” (Chatterjee). How will the government account for the trauma they’ve caused. In addition, the journey to the border is an overall traumatic
        experience. Detainment only adds onto the trauma, but also worsens their own mental health and personal development later in life. If migrant children are reunified with their parents/and or guardians, the government needs to account towards
        providing equitable mental health services to assist the migrant families.

      <p>
        What needs to be accounted is how can design be used to reconnect these children to their families. In my comparative analysis, I explored the concepts of mapping events and revealing the stories of immigrants. Both concepts are interesting
        and can used to map out a form or story to bring these children into light. If data can be manually entered by the children and parents as a reunification process and carefully routed to match them together. In addition, I want to create
        more awareness on the damage created by trump's actions. Since the whole act itself was predetermined by the administration, “ The Trump administration has been considering separating families at the border since the early months of his
        presidency, hoping that harsh treatment would deter illegal immigration” (Jordan). Somehow, I want to represent the damage created by trump, but also more attention needs to be given towards a solution in reuniting children to their
        families. While also providing resources to aid in the reunification process since there is mental consequences during reunification. This tool itself can be developed for activist groups or organizations since it’s not guaranteed that the
        children/and or the parents will have access to the internet. If possible a bilingual site would be ideal so it can be interpreted in both english and spanish. Overall, I want an experience that can aid the children in the reunification
        process.
